I am Zhenguo Jin, a software developer with over 4 years’ experience, and over 3 years’ Android development experience. I am currently working for <a href="http://www.keeeweee.com/" target="_blank">KeeeWeee</a> as a Senior Android Developer.

I have a keen interested in the latest emerging technologies. I use my spare time to turn my experience, ideas and love for Android tech into informative articles, tutorials and more in hope to help others and learn more.

I decided to write this blog because, while there is plenty of information regarding Android development in general, there is comparatively less information on styling and, in particular, theming Android apps. While much can be learned by browsing the Android source code, this can be a fairly difficult process, and often it is not easy to find precisely what you’re looking for.

It is assumed that the reader is familiar with Android development in general.
